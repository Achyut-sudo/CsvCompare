git clone https://usernmae@github.com/username/repo_name #to clone in git bash
git status #to get untracked files in the repo
git add . # to add file sto track by the .git 
git add <fileName> # to add specific file to dd tracking

git config --global user.email "user emailid"
git config --global user.name "user name"

git commit -m "commit title" -m "commitdesc"

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "user email id" # to create sshKey

ls | grep <keyName that was passed> # to search for ssskhey generated by the preceding command

# from the last to last command two keys will be generated <key name that was passed> and <key name that was passed>.pub 
# in which the later one is the public key and the other one is private key

# why git push origin master is not working but git push origin main is working
